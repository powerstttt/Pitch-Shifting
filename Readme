This project has been created for project of EEM 449. The subject of that is design an application on TM4C1294XL that get temperature and pressure values from SENSORHUB and two different weather forecast sites. SENSORHUB is used to get a value of temperature from TMP006 sensor and get a value of pressure from BMP180 sensor. The other temperature values are taken from OpenWeatherMap and eskisehir.mgm.gov.tr sites. The taken values are stored in global variables and sent to a server on port 5011 in local pc network. These values are read via SocketTest.
Code Composer Studio 9.2 was used to create this project. Also, SocketTest v3.0 was used to read values from port 5011.
